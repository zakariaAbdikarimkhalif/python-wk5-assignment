Animal Movement and Sound Demo

This Python project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including inheritance and polymorphism through an example involving animals and their behaviors.

 Description

The project defines a base class `Animal` and three subclasses:
- `Dog`
- `Bird`
- `Fish`

Each subclass overrides the `move()` and `speak()` methods to reflect species-specific behaviors.

Features

- Inheritance: All animals inherit common behavior from the `Animal` class.
- Method Overriding: Each subclass provides its own version of `move()` and `speak()`.
- Polymorphism: Demonstrates how different object types can be treated uniformly using a common interface.
